On April 15 join with us in solidarity with the national tax day marches to remind Donald Trump that we expect him to release his tax returns for the last 12 years.

This event is in conjunction with the Tax March in Washington, DC and marches taking place all over the country. It is focused on demanding Trump release his tax returns so that we can see both how much, if any, tax he is paying AND his financial connections, including sources of income and debt. We are also putting pressure on Congress to exercise it's authority to require him to release them.

The 3 pm protest at the Post Office is open to all. Speakers include Santa Rosa Vice Mayor Jack Tibbetts, and City Councilperson Chris Rogers.

Indivisible Sebastopol will meet at Doyle Park at 2:30 to walk to the Post Office together! See you there!!

Indivisible Sonoma County is holding a picnic before the march. If you want to attend their brown bag picnic at 1 pm you must register first: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/release-your-returns-indivisible-sonoma-county-picnic-protest-tickets-33292285121
