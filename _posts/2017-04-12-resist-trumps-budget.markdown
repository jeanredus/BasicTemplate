call-script-text: "**Call both Senators and your Representative: ** Hi, I'm a member
  of Indivisible Sebastopol calling from zip code ______. I'm asking \\[SENATOR/REPRESENTATIVE
  X\\] to do everything possible to retain key labor, education and health programs,
  as well as foreign aid and human rights programs and to block funding this month
  for the border wall, detention camps and mass deportation. It will be much harder
  to stop these anti-immigrant programs once they are partially funded."

**No Cuts, No Wall, No Deportation Force.** Congress needs to pass a new funding bill before the April 28th deadline, or the government will shut down. The massive cuts that Trump wants to make are astounding. He has proposed $18 billion in domestic spending cuts for the next 6 months of fiscal year 2017, mostly related to education, labor and health. The proposed budget also cuts funds for agencies supporting diplomacy, foreign aid, and human rightsâ€”programs that make the whole world safer.
