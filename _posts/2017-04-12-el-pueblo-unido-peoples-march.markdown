Over 3 dozen organizations are working in coalition for this day of unity and action. Combining the traditional local May Day march and rally with the People’s March for Jobs, Justice and Climate in Washington, DC, to create a united voice against destructive policies on immigration, Native American rights, public lands, environmental protections and alarming threats posed to marginalized populations in the US, including the LGBTQ community, women, immigrants, and people of all intersectional identities, regardless of their color, ability or faith. We are part of the nationwide effort to focus on like the Women's March on Jan. 21. \
